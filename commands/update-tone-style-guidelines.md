description: Incorporate those tone and style changes into the tone and style guidelines document
---

Synthesize the purpose and theme of those writing style and tone changes that I just provided, and modify, add to, or remove from C:\Users\Jonathan Chamberlin\.claude\skills\draft-and-revise\references\tone_style_guidelines.md to make it so future writing uses that tone.

Important: Identify ALL patterns from the corrections before starting edits. List them out, then apply every single one before finishing. Do not partially complete. If you identify 3 patterns, make 3 updates. Verify at the end that all identified patterns have been applied.
