- Open with the result or the surprise, not the setup. Do not open with "I spent X hours doing Y." That is setup. Start with what happened or what you didn't expect
- Show the delta, not the position. Speed of change is impressive, not current skill level
- Include one thing the reader can steal: a specific tool, technique, or realization
- Don't list features. Fold what you built into the story of building it
- Include at least one moment of confusion, failure, or surprise from the process
- Don't present stats as universal facts. Attribute to your experience or cut them
- End with something concrete you're doing next, not a vague plan or a lesson. "Expanding it" is not concrete. Name what you're actually adding or changing
- Don't name what you built and then immediately explain what it does in the same sentence. Either introduce it through action or define it without naming it first
- Don't open a paragraph with a definitional sentence ("X is a Y that does Z"). Drop into what happened instead
- When mentioning what you're building next, name one thing in a casual sentence. Don't list upcoming features in parallel Name-then-description pairs
- Don't introduce features with additive existential constructions ("There's also a...", "It also has a..."). Fold the feature into the story
- Don't use slang-intensity fillers ("locked in," "grinding") to signal effort. Replace with a specific action or result
- Don't drop the first-person subject ("I" or "I'm") from sentence openers to create stylistic punch. Keep the first-person anchor
- Don't pre-empt a negative reaction and then refute it ("I thought X. Instead Y"). If something felt counterintuitive, say what you found without staging the objection first
- Qualify broad behavioral claims as specific to your experience. "Turns out people X" should be "I noticed X" or cut
- Fold short comparison or reversal sentences into the preceding sentence using "but" or "though." Don't leave them standalone
- Don't write defensive statements after wins. State the result and stop; don't rationalize why the win doesn't fully count
- Avoid clean conditional axioms ("There's a reason X"). Say what you observed, not a self-evident principle
- Don't extend feature names with cause-effect outcome clauses ("a system that makes you X"). If the outcome is implied, cut
- Don't open a paragraph with a difficulty-qualifier frame ("X was the hardest part to get right"). Show what made it hard through a specific moment or cut
