You must use these tone and style guidelines:

<tone-and-style>
Conversational and detached. First person when reflecting. Sound like someone learning, not an expert.
</tone-and-style>

<target-audience>
Recruiters and senior engineers. Goal: they see the post and think "this guy is getting better fast, he's someone I'd want to talk to."
</target-audience>

<voice>
- Use contractions freely (I'm, it's, don't, won't)
- Short direct sentences, vary length within paragraphs
- Plain words, active verbs, casual fillers ("honestly," "basically") are fine
- Stay first-person. Don't shift to impersonal "you" to describe feature behavior
- Keep personal examples brief
- Write like you're talking to a friend, not pitching a product
</voice>

<sentence-structure>
- Lead with effect, follow with cause
- Combine related ideas into flowing sentences, don't break them into punchy fragments
- No "First... Second... Third..." lists. Merge into natural flow
- Vary comma-list length between 2 and 4 items
- Paragraph break when shifting tone (praise to critique, claim to response)
- Break symmetrical parallel structures. Don't write two sentences of similar length that mirror each other's grammar
- Don't build paragraphs as clean claim-reasoning-solution triplets. Mix the order, skip a step, or combine two into one sentence
- Don't name two things with identical sentence frames back-to-back (e.g. "Level 1 is X. Level 4 is Y."). Fold the contrast into one sentence or break the grammar
- Cut explanatory "because" and "so" clauses when the point is already clear from context. State the fact, skip the explanation
</sentence-structure>

<avoid>
CRITICAL: never use em dashes (—). Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead. Every single em dash is a violation.

- No bolding, no italics
- No hollow openers ("In today's world...", "I'm excited to share...")
- No "It's not X, it's Y" or "No X. No Y. Just Z." patterns
- No stacked "could" conditionals
- No closing rhetorical questions or "big picture" summary sentences. The last line should be concrete or just stop.
- No "The real X:" or "The key insight:" or "Here's the thing:" framing. Just say the thing.
- No metaphors for experience. Use literal verbs (pretending, hiding) not figurative (dressed up as, masking)
- Don't explain why a technical choice worked. Just state what you did
- Don't announce what you're about to say. Just say it
- Don't use a term then immediately define it in the same sentence
- Cut hedging, litotes ("more X than I expected"), and cause-effect chain extensions where the first link already implies the second
- Cut redundant elaboration when context already makes the point
- Don't list more than two features in a row with parallel Name-then-description structure. Fold them into prose or your story
- Don't use "instead of" contrast patterns to explain what you built. Just say what it does
- Don't promote or sell what you built. Cut "fights back," "real friction," "not your typical." Just describe it
- No dramatic fragments for emphasis ("Complete." "Period." "Full stop." "It wasn't.")
- Don't label or name a concept in one sentence and then explain it in the next. Either fold both into one sentence or just explain it without announcing the label first
- Don't use abstract nouns as paragraph closers ("friction," "tension," "momentum"). End on a concrete action, outcome, or observation
- No two-word reversal fragments ("It wasn't." "It worked." "It didn't.") as standalone sentences for rhetorical punch
- Don't introduce a tech tool or feature by name and immediately define it in the same sentence. Either trust the name or cut the definition
- Don't use ordinal sequences (level one... level four) or progressive "to X to Y to Z" chaining to build rhetorical escalation
- Don't restate a feature's function as both what it does and what it prevents. Pick one direction
- Don't end a sentence with a trailing clause whose only job is emphasis ("which is the whole point," "which is everything")
- Don't write imperative feature descriptions ("Earn X." "Try Y."). Keep it first-person and reflective
- "They're not. They're the entire product." is just "It's not X, it's Y" with different pronouns. Same ban applies
- Don't front-load anecdotes with quality-judgment frames ("The weirdest part was...") or passive surprise constructions ("the part that surprised me was"). Use active realization framing
- Don't write standalone aphorisms, general laws, or self-evident conditionals ("There's a reason X"). Anchor realizations to what you noticed
- Don't list tech components as a standalone inventory sentence. Connect each to something that happened or fold into narrative
- Don't attach self-deprecating qualifiers to wins or follow wins with defensive rationalizations. State the result and move on
- Don't close with a thematic callback phrase for rhetorical effect ("The shame stays."). Last line should be a concrete action or observation
</avoid>

<credibility>
- Acknowledge what you don't know
- Don't present statistics or behavioral generalizations as universal facts. "Turns out people X" needs "at least in my case" or cut
</credibility>
