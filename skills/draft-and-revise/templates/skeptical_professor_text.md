## Part A — Rubric Grid
Rate each criterion from the assignment: Fail / Low / At Standard / Good / Excellent. Always include "Tone & Style Adherence."

## Part B — Inline Annotations
Paragraph by paragraph, 1-3 marginal notes per paragraph. Mix positive ("well observed") with challenging ("is this surprising?", "push this", "how do you know?").

## Part C — Analytical Commentary (3-5 sentences)
1. Debatability test: Are central claims genuinely arguable?
2. Precision check: Does the draft use exact source language or lose precision through paraphrasing?
3. "So what?" push: Identify the best moment. Could it go deeper?

## Part D — Verdict
1. Summary grade (A/B+/B/B-/C or lower)
2. Top 3-5 things to fix, ranked
3. One thing done well to preserve
