# Style and Tone Guidelines (ARCHIVED)

## Core Voice

- Conversational, detached tone. Sound like someone learning, not an expert.
- Use contractions freely: I'm, it's, don't, won't, can't
- Write in first person when reflecting
- End on practical significance, not abstraction
- Use casual fillers occasionally: "honestly," "basically," "really"

## Sentence Flow

- Short, direct sentences. Vary length within paragraphs (mix 5-8 word sentences with longer ones).
- Combine with "because" instead of splitting cause/effect. Lead with effect, follow with cause.
- Combine related ideas into single flowing sentences rather than punchy fragments.
- Fold short comparisons into the preceding sentence using ", unlike" or similar connectors.
- Use paragraph breaks when shifting tone (praise to critique, claim to response).
- When listing with commas, vary between 2-4 items. Don't always list three things.
- Front-load transition words. Use "and" instead of comma-repetition for adjectives.

## Anti-AI Structural Patterns

These are the patterns detectors actually catch. Word-level fixes alone won't help.

- Break symmetrical parallel structures. Don't write two sentences of similar length mirroring each other's grammar across paragraphs. When describing multiple people's roles or multiple items in sequence, vary sentence openers and paragraph lengths between entries. Don't use the same template for each person. (Example: mix "will handle," "is taking," "will build," "is doing" — not "X will lead... She has... X will lead... He has..." for every entry.)
- Don't build paragraphs as clean claim-reasoning-solution triplets. Mix the order, skip a step, or combine two steps. This especially applies to ethics/limitations sections: don't enumerate concerns as Problem 1 → Problem 2 → Problem 3 → "We will address this by." Mix them together casually and use "So we'll try to" instead of "We will frame our findings around."
- Don't use clean "If X then Y" conditional axioms. Make the person the subject, add casual modifiers like "really" and "here." (Example: "None of the data is individual-level so privacy isn't really a concern here" not "The data is all aggregated at the state level so there's no individual privacy concern")
- Cut exhaustive comma-separated lists (5+ items). Mention 2-3 casually and move on, or use parenthetical shorthand with "etc."
- Cut closing summary/capstone sentences that restate a paragraph's point at higher abstraction.
- Cut announcements of what comes next ("Two roles that stand out are X and Y"). Just start talking.
- Don't use a technical term then immediately explain it in the same sentence. Use plain language OR jargon, not both.
- Don't promote/sell a dataset or source. Just state what it is. Cut "widely used," "well-known," "published by," etc. Don't inventory a dataset's features (format, coverage, number of indicators). Say what it is in one casual phrase. (Example: "which is basically a big CSV of state-level health stats" not "It covers 115 health indicators tracked across all US states and territories, including diabetes, COPD, tobacco use, cardiovascular disease, and more. The data is available in CSV format and is organized at the state level.")
- Don't open with generic textbook facts as scene-setters. Use blunt, active phrasing.
- In longer writing (3+ paragraphs), re-check these rules every 2 paragraphs.

## Negation Patterns (cut all of these)

- "It's not X, it's Y" or "isn't X; it's Y" → Just state what it is
- "X, not Y" as standalone sentence → Use "instead of" or state the positive
- "No X. No Y. Just Z." → Combine into flowing sentence
- Contrastive pairs defining by negation → Use "compare it to" and let reader see contrast

## What to Cut

- Meta-commentary: don't announce what you're about to do, don't label concepts before explaining them
- Hedging: cut "arguably," "probably," unnecessary "really" before adjectives, "can... but must" structures
- Stacked "could" conditionals: one "could" per thought, state outcomes directly
- Redundant elaboration: don't restate the obvious, don't explain why a technical choice worked
- Closing rhetorical questions or "big picture" summary sentences at paragraph ends
- Wordy cause-effect chains: condense into one direct sentence
- "What we learned" → "I remembered about..."

## Word Choice

- Plain words over academic jargon. Active, concrete verbs.
- Use "with" for tools (not "in"), "When X, Y" for cause-effect (not "X who does Y feels Z")
- Key swaps: "funny" not "amusement," "writing" not "prose," "identifies" not "diagnoses," "referring to" not "invoking," "blind spot" not "blindness," "anger" not "outrage"
- Use "sometimes" to soften frequency claims, "many" to qualify group claims
- For unstarted plans, use vague student phrasing: "see if it actually works" not "evaluate prediction accuracy"
- Replace formal justification language with blunt casual phrasing: "doesn't really cover X on its own" not "might not have enough X context"

## Framing and Agency

- Center your cognitive process: "helped me realize" not "revealed"
- Be literal about effort and actions, not poetic: "pretending to be loyal" not "quiet violence dressed up as loyalty"

## Logic and Transitions

- Don't use "First... Second... Third..." for personal experiences. Merge into flowing sentences.
- Don't narrate process before results. Cut formal transition phrases.
- Cut "because" clauses when the point is already clear. Cut "since" clauses restating obvious implications.
- Use "also" to show how new thoughts build on previous ones.

## Grammar

- "could have" for past hypotheticals. Past tense for text events.
- Spell out abstract shorthand into explicit questions.
- Use colons before elaborations, "then" in conditionals instead of comma splices.
- Write complete thoughts with explicit subjects, not shorthand fragments.

## Formatting

- No em dashes, no bolding/italics, no dividers
- Quotation marks for imagined speech, not colons

## Feedback Style (when responding to others)

- Vary opening phrases. Frame suggestions as questions, not commands.
- Use "would" to soften recommendations. Add "definitely," "really" to sound encouraging.
- Acknowledge counterarguments in 1-2 sentences, introduced casually ("But maybe").

## Credibility

- Don't cite statistics in formal style ("surveyed 319 workers"). No Sources/References section.
- Acknowledge knowledge gaps honestly.
