## 1. Sentence Architecture

### Length distribution (high burstiness)

Jonathan's sentences swing between extremes. Short punches (2-7 words) sit next to longer explanatory sentences (20-35 words). This variance is his most distinctive feature.

**Short punches from actual writing:**
- "They won't." (2 words)
- "He did not." (3 words)
- "The phrase stopped me." (4 words)
- "It was not obvious to me." (6 words)
- "That is a decision." (4 words)
- "Looks like Mimikatz is a credential dumping tool." (8 words)

**Long sentences that follow:**
- "He could have named Babo or said 'the revolt' or 'my friend's death.'" (13 words, after short setup)
- "When Don Benito says 'the negro,' does he mean Babo alone, or does his refusal to name Babo suggest he's haunted by something larger than one person?" (28 words)
- "If the college experience is similar to the workforce in this way, the students can clearly see the effect AI use has on their cognitive abilities, and it gives them time to course correct before they enter the workforce." (39 words)

**Pattern:** Short declarative statement establishes the point. Longer sentence immediately after unpacks it. The short sentence is almost always the judgment; the long sentence is the reasoning.

### Sentence openers

Strongly favors starting with concrete subjects or "I":
- "I got stuck on..." / "I started wondering..." / "I hit..."
- "He wrapped himself..." / "Delano watched..." / "Greenblatt writes..."
- "The phrase..." / "The word..." / "That word..."
- "But" to start sentences (frequently, as a pivot)
- "Then" to advance chronologically

Almost never starts with:
- Gerunds ("Having considered...")
- Formal transitions ("Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally," "Consequently")
- Abstract nouns as subjects ("The significance of..." "The importance of...")

### Joining style

Prefers "and" or "but" to join independent clauses. Rarely uses semicolons. When connecting cause and effect, leads with the effect:

- "He wrapped himself in funeral imagery without realizing it." (effect first, then "without realizing" explains)
- "The phrase stopped me. Greenblatt was indicating that what came next should be obvious." (short effect, then explanation)

## 2. Diction and Word Choice

### Vocabulary register

Plain, concrete, active. Favors common words over academic ones even in formal essays:

| Jonathan uses | Instead of |
|---|---|
| "got stuck on" | "was arrested by" |
| "I hit" | "I encountered" |
| "threw out" | "discarded" |
| "caught my attention" | "proved noteworthy" |
| "doing quiet work" | "subtly functioning" |
| "sounds more like a sales pitch" | "resembles promotional rhetoric" |
| "something you throw out" | "something deemed expendable" |
| "pulled out" | "extracted" |
| "came back as" | "was identified as" |
| "tons of warnings" | "numerous security alerts" |
| "basically clean" | "largely benign" |

### Verbs

Active, physical verbs even for intellectual processes:
- "I kept rereading" / "I started wondering" / "I slowed down"
- "His body chose death imagery for him"
- "The category collapsed back onto the person who used it"
- "His categories turned it into a compliment"
- "The phrase helped me realize"

### Contractions

Uses them freely and naturally: "I'm," "it's," "don't," "won't," "can't," "didn't," "couldn't," "he'd," "they're," "I've," "that's"

### Words never used

Jonathan never uses: "delve," "nuanced," "multifaceted," "tapestry," "landscape," "paradigm" (except once, self-aware), "leverage," "robust," "seamless," "compelling," "elegant," "transformative," "illuminate," "profound," "vibrant," "underscores," "highlights," "notably"

## 3. Argument Structure

### How claims get built

Jonathan builds arguments by accumulation, not by announcement. He doesn't say "I will now argue X." He shows his thinking process and lets the claim emerge:

1. Quote or observation
2. "I noticed..." / "I got stuck on..." / "caught my attention"
3. Concrete analysis of specific words or details
4. "That matters because..." / "This matters for my argument because..."

**Example (Unit 2):**
> "A pall is a cloth draped over coffins. He wrapped himself in funeral imagery without realizing it. That word 'unconsciously' matters because the thing haunting him has moved past what words can reach."

Notice: definition → observation → "matters because" → judgment. No announcement, no meta-commentary.

### Counterargument handling

Introduces counterarguments with casual pivots, not formal headers:
- "But maybe 'of course' is just a linguistic habit."
- "This objection is reasonable but misses the point."
- "But I also think the 'just habit' argument underestimates Greenblatt."
- "But the whole point of the exercise is that the labels are all we have."

Responds directly and concretely, doesn't hedge:
- "Intent does not determine effect."
- "Refusing to decide is itself a decision that has consequences."

### Logic connectors

- "because" (inline, mid-sentence, for causation)
- "so" (casual consequence)
- "but" (pivot, often sentence-initial)
- "then" (chronological or logical sequence)
- "instead" (contrast)
- "that's how" / "that's why" (tying back)

Never uses: "furthermore," "moreover," "in addition," "consequently," "thus," "hence"

## 4. Rhetorical Identity

### Posture: learner, not expert

Jonathan consistently positions himself as someone figuring things out, not someone who already knows:
- "As I kept rereading this exchange, I started wondering..."
- "I'm not sure who his 'leader' is... and I think the ambiguity matters."
- "I didn't question that redefinition until I slowed down to close read."
- "Initially, I found it funny... But that amusement shifted into something else."

This is his most consistent trait across all genres. Even in the Medium posts where he's more assertive, he frames ideas as discoveries rather than pronouncements.

### Comfort with uncertainty

- "I'm not sure who his 'leader' is"
- "I think the ambiguity matters" (hedges with "I think," not "arguably")
- "The rhetorical framing may have done as much..."

### Directness in opinion pieces

In Medium posts, the posture shifts to direct and sometimes confrontational:
- "If the student doesn't learn, that's their fault."
- "Do you want to be smart or dumb?"
- "Refusing to decide is itself a decision that has consequences."
- "In every case, the student benefits."

But even here, he uses personal experience as the basis for claims, not abstract authority:
- "During my 2.5 years before this semester, I ran a marketing agency..."
- "I have a friend who I respect a lot. He said..."

## 5. Paragraph Structure

### Length and rhythm

Paragraphs vary significantly in length. In academic writing, some are 3-4 sentences, others are 8-10. In Medium posts, many paragraphs are 1-2 sentences.

### How paragraphs end

Jonathan does NOT use capstone/summary sentences at paragraph ends. His paragraphs typically end on:
- A specific concrete detail: "...a compliment about grooming skills."
- A judgment that opens a new thought: "...the exclusion would be built into how he thinks about writing itself."
- A consequence: "...connecting Don Benito to the entire system of slavery he profited from, not just to Babo."

He never ends paragraphs with "Thus, we can see that..." or "This demonstrates..." or any restatement of the paragraph's main point.

### How paragraphs begin

Often starts with the subject of analysis or a direct reference back:
- "Right after the exchange..."
- "During the shaving scene..."
- "Duncan Faherty argues that..."
- "Both examples do the same work..."

## 6. Formatting and Punctuation

- **No em dashes.** Uses commas or restructures the sentence instead.
- **No semicolons** in casual writing. Rare in academic writing.
- **No bold or italics** for emphasis in body text.
- **Quotation marks** for direct quotes and for calling attention to specific words ("the negro," "of course," "dispensing with").
- **Periods over exclamation marks.** Even when making strong claims.
- **Colons** before elaboration or lists (used sparingly).

## 7. Genre-Specific Patterns

### Academic essays (ENGW3309)

- Thesis emerges from close reading, not stated upfront as a rule
- Quotes embedded in sentences with analysis immediately after
- "I" used freely for interpretive process
- Scholars referenced by last name after introduction
- Works Cited in MLA format

### CTF writeups (CY2550)

- Process-oriented: "I opened... I found... I pasted..."
- Documents search queries with "Yahoo:" labels
- Extremely concise, no filler, no hedging
- States facts and moves on
- Screenshots referenced inline with backtick filenames

### Medium opinion pieces

- Short paragraphs (often 1-2 sentences)
- "You" addressing reader directly
- Rhetorical questions to reader
- Personal experience as primary evidence
- Sign-off: "Yours in Solutions, Jonathan Chamberlin"
- More confrontational, willing to make absolute claims

### Bloggy responses (ENGW3309)

- Opens with specific praise tied to the text
- Pushes close reading with concrete suggestions
- Questions as suggestions ("What if you explored..." / "Would it help to...")
- Casual encouragers: "really," "definitely"

## 8. Signature Moves (Few-Shot Reference)

These are Jonathan's most distinctive constructions. When imitating his voice, these patterns should appear naturally:

**The "matters because" connector:**
> "That word 'unconsciously' matters because the thing haunting him has moved past what words can reach."

**The concrete-then-abstract:**
> "A pall is a cloth draped over coffins. He wrapped himself in funeral imagery without realizing it."

**The "could have... but" counterfactual:**
> "He could have named Babo or said 'the revolt' or 'my friend's death.' Instead he said 'the negro,' a category."
> "The authors could have written 'removing' or 'replacing,' but 'dispensing with' carries a tone of dismissal."

**The thinking-process reveal:**
> "As I kept rereading this exchange, I started wondering where the weight of those two words comes from."
> "I didn't question that redefinition until I slowed down to close read."

**The "that's how" tiebacks:**
> "That's how thoroughly they controlled what he could perceive."

**The blunt judgment after buildup:**
> "Greenblatt was not talking to me. He was talking to someone else."
> "They won't. They will get worse until you learn."

**The casual counterargument pivot:**
> "But maybe 'of course' is just a linguistic habit."
> "This objection is reasonable but misses the point."
