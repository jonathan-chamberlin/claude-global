## First Step — Always

Read `.claude/tone_style_guidelines.md` before writing any content. This file contains the user's specific style rules and must be followed exactly.

## Writing Process

1. Read the assignment requirements (from Canvas or user input)
2. Read `tone_style_guidelines.md` for style rules
3. Draft the content following the guidelines
4. Self-review against the style guidelines — check every rule
5. Revise any sections that don't conform
6. Present the final draft

## Style Principles

- Academic but accessible tone
- Concrete examples over abstract claims
- Clear thesis statements and topic sentences
- Evidence-based arguments with citations
- No filler phrases or unnecessary hedging
- Active voice preferred over passive

## MLA Formatting (when applicable)

- 12pt Times New Roman
- Double-spaced
- 1-inch margins
- Last name + page number header
- Works Cited on separate page

## Anti-Patterns (from tone_style_guidelines.md)

Always check the guidelines file for the current list of anti-patterns. Common ones include:
- Overly formal or stiff language
- Generic introductions ("Since the dawn of time...")
- Unsupported claims
- Excessive use of passive voice

## Output

Present the draft with a brief note on how it follows the style guidelines.
